# Python Practice Projects 🚀

This repository is a structured collection of programming exercises designed to strengthen my Python skills through practical problem-solving.

## 📌 Structure

The repo contains multiple folders, each representing a category or source of problems. Currently, the primary focus is:

- `#1 from practicepython.org`:  
  Solutions to exercises from [PracticePython.org](https://www.practicepython.org/), organized by problem number and title.

Each problem has its own folder containing:
main.py
README.md (if needed)
Others (if needed)

## ✅ Progress Snapshot

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

This repo is part of my structured learning journey in:
- Python Programming
- Problem Solving
- Data Handling (JSON, I/O)
- Visualization (Bokeh)
- Clean Code & Refactoring

I’ve also started using modules like `random`, `datetime`, `json`, and `bokeh` to expand my skills.

## 🤖 Use of AI

I occasionally used AI as a **mentor-assistant**, especially to:
- Understand complex logic
- Explore alternate solutions
- Get unstuck quickly

Every solution was **understood and manually verified** — no blind copy-pasting.

## 🔥 What’s Next?
I plan to continue developing my Python skills through:

✅ Solving more PracticePython.org problems

⏳ Timeline: Undecided — I’m progressing at my own pace, prioritizing consistency and depth over deadlines.
