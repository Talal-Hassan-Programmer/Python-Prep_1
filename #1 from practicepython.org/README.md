### ðŸ’¬ Notes on AI Usage

Some exercises were solved with the **help of AI tools for learning purposes only**.  
I used AI to:
- Understand logic and syntax
- Compare solutions
- Refactor or validate my own ideas

ðŸš« *I never submitted AI-generated code blindly. Every line was tested, understood, and modified if needed.*
